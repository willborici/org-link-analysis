# Evidence-Based Organizational Links Analysis
Organizational link analysis driven by research has the potential to establish healthy ecosystems

This can be handled by gephi or cytoscape but at a cost. For gephi, there's only one edge modeled between any two vertices. Cytoscape is very complex for this use case, but can handle very large graphs better (arguably). Thus, building this on two fronts. First, the data model for organizational entities and the semantic relationship between nodes (employees, teams, departments, etc.). Second, the graph-theoretic algorithms focusing on centrality measures, betweeness, clusters, etc., to analyze organizational network dynamics, power structures, information brokers, and such. The visual appeal comes third, but is equally important to accompany the verbal argument.
